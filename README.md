# Security Tool Docker Images

Some Docker images of security tools that I've used, based off a common base image (Ubuntu:18.04).  The idea is to help avoid the dependency mess that is so easy to get into with security tools which want a lot of specific libraries and software versions

Using a common base image will help reduce disk space needed, Ubuntu:18.04 used as it's well supported and will get updates for quite a while to come.
